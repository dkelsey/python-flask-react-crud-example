# Build a Simple CRUD App with Python, Flask, and React

This is Project is based on [Build a Simple CRUD App with Python, Flask, and React](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/12/20/crud-app-with-python-flask-react)

It differs in two ways:

1. It integrates with Keycloak and not Okta as the original did.
2. I wrote `yaml` templates so that the app can be deployed into OpenShift - the templates and a `README` with basic instructions are found in the `tools` branch.

#### _Note: The text below is unedited from the original Author_


This tutorial show how to build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application using Python with Flask as the API and React for the front-end.

Please read the [Build a Simple CRUD App with Python, Flask, and React](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/12/20/crud-app-with-python-flask-react) to see the step-by-step instructions for creating this application.
